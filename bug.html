This bug arises when using Tailwind CSS's `@apply` directive with a complex class selector that results in unexpected CSS output.  For example, applying a class that uses the `&:hover` pseudo-class within a parent class may not work correctly. 

```html
<button class="bg-blue-500 hover:bg-blue-700 text-white font-bold py-2 px-4 rounded @apply hover:border-red-500">
  Click Me
</button>
```

The `@apply hover:border-red-500` might not apply correctly to the hover state.
